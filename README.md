# Introduction
## ESI_Community
This repository contains the source code and assets for a website that allows students of ESI SBA to upload and download documents. The website is designed to be a central location for sharing academic resources, such as lecture notes, study guides, and practice exams
## Objective
Our goal is to develop a web app that dynamically builds a database of documents based on user interactions with posts.


# Authentication
Sign up is limited to ESI-SBA email accounts for enhanced security and a trusted user community.

# Create Content
 Users are limited to posting documents related to their current year of study at our school. for example: if you are in 2CP you can post about 1CP or 2CP.
  In order to maintain consistency and quality within our web app, we kindly request users to adhere to the following guidelines when creating posts:
* 1- Title and Description: Please provide a clear and informative title along with a detailed description for your post. This helps other users understand the content and purpose of your document.
* 2- File Format: We recommend uploading files in PDF or image formats. These formats ensure compatibility and ease of access for other users.
By following these guidelines, we can create a user-friendly environment where posts are well-structured, searchable, and accessible to everyone.
